    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of project management is assigning employees to tasks, and doing so in an efficient manner.\n",
    "Several aspects can be considered such as decreasing worker boredom _[1]_, maximizing productivity, or increasing robustness to workers not showing up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is focusing on minimizing the time to complete a project, given a set of workers and tasks.\n",
    "Our unique twist is to account for how repeating a task can lead to decreasing time required to complete it, which we call the workerâ€™s _learning model_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to find an optimal schedule for assigning workers with specific set of skills to a set of tasks.\n",
    "Each task has a defined amount of work that needs to be done in order to complete a task, and the amount of time a worker spends on completing a task depends on his or her skill set.\n",
    "In addition, when a worker completes a task, they become more skilled at performing that task, completing it more quickly in the future.\n",
    "An optimal schedule could minimize the length of a project timeline by assigning workers to tasks that match the skills they have, or it might assign a low skill worker to a job several times to in order for them to learn the skill and be highly productive in the long run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this project comes from work with Engineers Without Borders.\n",
    "As designs for a bridge, a microgrid, or a water system are finalized, a construction schedule must be planned.\n",
    "Every household in the community contributes a person to the construction, which means access to a large amount of labor; however, these workers are not typically highly skilled in the type of required work.\n",
    "However, at low skill levels, repeated work can lead to a rapidly increasing productivity **[cite?]**.\n",
    "A tool to better estimate how worker productivity may change over the course of a project would dramatically help in the creation of feasible project timelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In large projects, the number of tasks often significantly outnumbers the workers and we must decide how to assign our workers.\n",
    "Do we have workers that specialize in a task and complete it quickly, or instead have workers who can generalize and complete a variety of tasks more slowly.  How do we assign our workers to a project timeline to optimize the completion time?\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop a model to find an optimal schedule for worker assignment based on the amount of work each task requires and the skill level of each worker.\n",
    "This model can be useful for a wide array of applications.\n",
    "For example, developing a construction timeline and determining what combination of worker assignments will allow a project to be completed quickly.\n",
    "An additional use may be to decide if it will be more productive to have a worker learn on the job or instead give a worker training where they stop producing work but may return with a higher skill level. \n",
    "\n",
    "We data for our model, using very broad assumptions/estimates.\n",
    "Our goal is to prove that that our model can be viable for a variety of assignment problems, rather focus on a specific worker dataset.\n",
    "We will create worker skill levels and learning speeds from gaussian distributions **[update?]** restricted to a sensible range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the variety of types of tasks in a project, the quantity of those tasks, the number of workers, and any initial skills the workers have, we can expect a different optimal assignment of tasks to workers.\n",
    "This is leads to a question of whether workers should generalize or specialize in a skill, or how short-term optimal worker assignment compares to long-term optimal assignment.\n",
    "Our project hopes to provide an answer to these questions and their dependency on initial conditions. \n",

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution.
